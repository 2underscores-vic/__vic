<title>General structure and usage</title>

<p>The topmost structural units of the library are headers and the library file
(or archive) - <tt>lib__vic.a</tt> or <tt>__vic.lib</tt>. All the headers are
located in the <tt>__vic/</tt> subdirectory. One should include them like
this:</p>

<code-block lang="C++">
#include &lt;__vic/<nt>header.h</nt>>
</code-block>

<p>Where <tt><nt>header.h</nt></tt> is a name of the desired header.</p>

<p>Almost all the code is placed within <tt>__vic</tt> namespace, including
other namespaces.</p>

<p>During program linking, the library file must be given to the linker.
Example:</p>

<tty>
$ g++ -std=c++11 prog.cpp -l__vic
</tty>

<p>The library has 2 modes: C++11 mode and C++98 mode. Features available
only in C++11 mode are marked with <sign>C++11</sign> sign. Features available
only in C++98 mode are marked with <sign>C++98</sign> sign, respectively. Also
in C++98 mode the library file has slightly different name:</p>

<tty>
$ g++ -std=c++98 prog.cpp -l__vic98
</tty>

<note>C++11 mode is used for C++14/17 as well.</note>

<p>Detailed description of the library components provided in subsequent
chapters. Descriptions are grouped by headers. Mainly C++11 language syntax
is used as more complete and expressive.</p>
