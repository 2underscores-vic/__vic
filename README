BRANCHES

iso
    Potentially terminal branch containing only facilities that can be built
    strictly on top of some version of ISO C++ standard.

posix, windows
    Terminal branches containing platform-specific facilities and facilities
    from iso branch optimized for the platform.

generic
    Nonterminal branch containing common parts (usually interfaces and doc) of
    platform-specific branches.

exp/*
    Topic branches for experimental features.

Typical workflow of merging the branches looks like this:

                  / posix
iso -> generic ->
                  \ windows
