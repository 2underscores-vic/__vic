__vic's C++ library
(c) Victor Dyachenko aka __vic <victor.dyachenko@protonmail.com> since 2007


OVERVIEW

__vic library is a collection of useful lightweight C++ utilities that I use
in my everyday activity. Most parts of the library have been written using
standard C++. Various extensions are used for optimization but for all of them
implementation with standard facilities is supplied.

The essential information about the library can be found in doc/ subdirectory
that contains XML-sources of the documentation that can be converted to HTML
(via XSLT).

BRANCHES

iso
    Potentially terminal branch containing only facilities that can be built
    strictly on top of some version of ISO C++ standard.

posix, windows
    Terminal branches containing platform-specific facilities and facilities
    from iso branch optimized for the platform.

generic
    Nonterminal branch containing common parts (usually interfaces and doc) of
    platform-specific branches.

exp/*
    Topic branches for experimental features.

Typical workflow of merging the branches looks like this:

                  / posix
iso -> generic ->
                  \ windows
